# Contributing to WireCloud

Looking to contribute something to WireCloud? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Wirecloud/wirecloud/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports) and
[features requests](#feature-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Stack
  Overflow ([`fiware-wirecloud`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fiware-wirecloud)
  tag) is a better place to get help.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What
would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix
any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Code guidelines

### HTML

- Four spaces for indentation, never tabs.
- Double quotes only, never single quotes.
- Always use proper indentation.
- Use tags and elements appropriate for an XHTML5 doctype (e.g., self-closing tags).

### CSS

- Multiple-line approach (one property and value per line).
- Always a space after a property's colon (e.g., `display: block;` and not `display:block;`).
- End all lines with a semi-colon.
- Attribute selectors, like `input[type="text"]` should always wrap the attribute's value in double quotes, for consistency and safety (see this [blog post on unquoted attribute values](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values) that can lead to XSS attacks).
- Attribute selectors should only be used where absolutely necessary (e.g., form controls) and should be avoided on custom components for performance and explicitness.
- Series of classes for a component should include a base class (e.g., `.component`) and use the base class as a prefix for modifier and sub-components (e.g., `.component-lg`).
- Avoid inheritance and over nestingâ€”use single, explicit classes whenever possible.
- When feasible, default color palettes should comply with [WCAG color contrast guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast).
- Except in rare cases, don't remove default `:focus` styles (via e.g. `outline: none;`) without providing alternative styles. See [this A11Y Project post](http://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/) for more details.

### JS

- Four spaces for indentation, never tabs.
- strict mode.
- "Attractive".
- Use jshint (there is a .jshintrc file on the source code of WireCloud ;-).
